  I am a master student in the <a href='http://lst.hzau.edu.cn/'>College of Life Science and Technology</a> in <a href='http://www.hzau.edu.cn/'>Huazhong Agricultural University</a> and the major is genomics,which is a major in biological data analysis. I am interested in Applied Mathematics and Statistics,especially for applying mathematical theory to biology.When I am undergraduate,I have minored some related courses in applied statistics and developed a keen interest in how to apply mathematical models to biology.During the master degree, in first two years I worked in zebrafish and once analyzed NGS data(mainly RNA-seq,scRNA-seq).In last year my main job is to develop biology software,which is predicting dynamic G4 structure(G quadruplex).
