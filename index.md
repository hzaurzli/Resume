    I am a master student in the <a href='http://lst.hzau.edu.cn/'>College of Life Science and Technology</a> in <a href='http://www.hzau.edu.cn/'>Huazhong Agricultural University</a> and the major is genomics,which is a major in biological data analysis. I am interested in Applied Mathematics and Statistics,especially for applying mathematical theory to biology.When I am undergraduate,I have minored some related courses in applied statistics and developed a keen interest in how to apply mathematical models to biology.During the master degree, in first two years I worked in zebrafish and once analyzed NGS data(mainly RNA-seq,scRNA-seq).In last year my main job is to develop biology software,which is predicting dynamic G4 structure(G quadruplex).

  <p>
    Before I got my master's degree,I have some programming skills(R,Python and maybe a little C++) and use machine learning models or Mathematical models to analyze biological data(R:mlr,glmnet etc;Python:scikit-learn,sklearn,pytorch etc).I also participate in building biological database(flask + jquery or vue).I like to take notes while reading literature,recording the logic or principle of the article.It was a lot of fun in my learning process. Sometimes I will share my learning records or good ideas in the <a href='https://www.jianshu.com/u/ecfc4115cd90'>Jianshu</a> and <a href='https://www.yuque.com/u1629231/qd3xf6'>Yuque</a>(Welcome to discuss with me üòâ)
  </p>
  <p>
     I am better at analyzing NGS data,during the analysis I can combine some mathematical models in the analysis data, the purpose is to better mine the biological story,if results are solid, I prefer to develop biological software for more researchers to use. At last, I share a slogan with all guys(but it is in Chinese): "Â≠∏ÂïèÊ±ÇÂàáÂØ¶,ÊÄùËæ®Ê±ÇÁøîÂØ¶".
