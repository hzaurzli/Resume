    I am a master student in the <a href='http://lst.hzau.edu.cn/'>College of Life Science and Technology</a> in <a href='http://www.hzau.edu.cn/'>Huazhong Agricultural University</a> and the major is genomics,which is a major in biological data analysis. I am interested in Applied Mathematics and Statistics,especially for applying mathematical theory to biology.When I am undergraduate,I have minored some related courses in applied statistics and developed a keen interest in how to apply mathematical models to biology.During the master degree, in first two years I worked in zebrafish and once analyzed NGS data(mainly RNA-seq,scRNA-seq).In last year my main job is to develop biology software,which is predicting dynamic G4 structure(G quadruplex).
  </p>
  <p>
    Before I got my master's degree,I have some programming skills(R,Python and maybe a little C++) and use machine learning models or mathematical models to analyze biological data(R:mlr,glmnet etc;Python:scikit-learn,sklearn,pytorch etc).I also participate in building biological database(flask + jquery or vue).I like to take notes while reading literature,recording the logic or principle of the article.It was a lot of fun in my learning process. Sometimes I will share my learning records or good ideas in the <a href='https://www.jianshu.com/u/ecfc4115cd90'>Jianshu</a> and <a href='https://www.yuque.com/u1629231/qd3xf6'>Yuque</a> (Welcome to discuss with me 😉)
  </p>
  <p>
     I am better at analyzing NGS data,during the analysis I can combine some mathematical models in the analysis data, the purpose is to better mine the biological story,if results are solid, I prefer to develop biological software for more researchers to use. At last, I share a slogan with all guys(but it is in Chinese): "學問求切實,思辨求翔實".

**1.Construction of a zebrafish sex reversal model**

The main purpose of this study was to construct a model of sex reversal with the aim of studying sex development in zebrafish,and [patent](item_1.md) pending for related technology.

**2.Multi-omics analysis of sex development in zebrafish**

Multi-omics study based on zebrafish sex reversal model,this part is used as my master thesis ,The repositories is [here](https://github.com/hzaurzli/Aquatic-institute),but it's private, Cooperation tutor: [@yhsun](http://people.ucas.ac.cn/~yhsun)

**3.BertG4 development**

Accurate prediction of G4 from a multi-omics perspective based on Bert framework,Cooperation tutor: [@wenzhang](http://coi.hzau.edu.cn/info/1162/4523.htm) and the repositories is [BertG4](https://github.com/hzaurzli/BertG4)

**4.Build Devogene Database**
