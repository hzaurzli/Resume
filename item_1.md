**Summaryï¼š** As a model organism, zebrafish has mastered the technology of reversing its sex, which brings a lot of convenience to the research on the mechanism of zebrafish sex determination. Mastering this technology provides certain technical means for molecular biology and cytology related research. Our female zebrafish gender inversion technology solves the technical problems related to female to male, and solves the problems of long time, difficult to obtain drugs and high cost of artificial synthesis.
Our proprietary use of exemestane for sex inversion in adult female zebrafish has the following advantages over the aforementioned Fadrozole female zebrafish sex inversion technique: 1. Exemestane (EM) is used as an aromatase inhibitor , At this stage, exemestane is easier to obtain in China than Fadrozole, and Fadrozole needs to be artificially synthesized, and the cost is high. 2. The use of exemestane (EM) immersion administration (100mL/L) makes the administration of each fish more uniform and avoids the fact that some zebrafish do not eat or are difficult to eat due to Fadrozole's feeding and administration method. Statistical shortcomings. 3. It takes less time than the Fadrozole administration method, and the phenomenon of sexual reversal can occur in 3 months, which is 2 months earlier than 5 months, which solves the time-consuming problem to a certain extent. 4. After sex reversal, female-to-male zebrafish can mate and fertilize with wild-type female zebrafish. 5. This technology can make male and female zebrafish fertilize and lay eggs without drug withdrawal.
