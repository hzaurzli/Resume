In summary, we present ArecaceaeMDB, a useful platform that integrates multi-omics data of Arecaceae, which provides a valuable resource for functional genome research and genetic breeding research of the Arecaceae family. In the future, ArecaceaeMDB will continuously update adding more published data, and adding other layers of -omics data (proteomics, epiomics, noncoding RNA, and so on) and further data analytical tools. We intend to make ArecaceaeMDB a central community portal through Arecaceae research worldwide and will provide long-term support, thus benefiting both research and industrial application of the study of Arecaceae.
